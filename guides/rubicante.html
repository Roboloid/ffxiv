	<h1>Mount Ordeals (Extreme)</h1>

	<p>Mount Ordeals (Extreme) is a high-end duty added in patch 6.3: Gods Revel, Lands Tremble.
		The fight can be unlocked by speaking to The Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan (12.7, 14.3) after completing Mount Ordeals.
	</p>

	<p>The minimum ilvl required to enter this fight is 610.</p>

	<h2>Hephaistos's Abilities</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b><u>Genesis of Flame</u></b>: A heavy raidwide attack.</li>
		<li><b><u>Volcanic Torches</u></b>: Hephaistos will draw blue lines on the 4x4 grid on the ground and ignite any squares that it closes a loop around.
			This attack is casted on the white lines / boxes.</li>
		<li><b><u>Sunforge</u></b>: Hephaistos will summon either a phoenix (hits the side columns) or a serpent (hits the center column) that blow up the 3x3 grid on the ground.
			This attack is casted on the black lines / boxes.</li>
		<li><b><u>Tetraflare</u></b>: Four sets of stack AOEs that target either all the supports or all the DPS. Support + DPS pairs should stack up to soak these.
			The size of the AOE is small, so try to be on top of each other.</li>
		<li><b><u>Octaflare</u></b>: Eight sets of spread AOEs that target everyone. Spread out to ensure people don't overlap.</li>
		<li><b><u>Conceptual Tetraflare</u></b> / <b><u>Conceptual Octaflare</u></b>: This <b>Tetraflare</b> or <b>Octaflare</b> attack is delayed and stored for later.
			When the next mechanic after this cast resolves, Hephaistos will always follow up with a <b>Sunforge</b>, and the <b>Conceptual Tetraflare</b> or <b>Conceptual Octaflare</b> will go off at the same time.</li>
		<li><b><u>Flameviper</u></b>: A tankbuster that hits twice. Each hit inflicts a Magic Vulnerability debuff and a DoT. During the cast, the OT should provoke and take aggro.
			As soon as the OT takes the second hit, the MT should provoke back, otherwise the OT will die due to the vuln. 
			One tank cannot use their invulnerability on this to take both, as the DoT will be boosted by the vuln and do lethal damage as soon as the invulnerability wears off.</li>
		<li><b><u>Reforged Reflection</u></b>: Hephaistos will shapeshift into either his snake form or his centaur form. He will do an attack as soon as the shapeshift animation finishes.
			If he turns into a snake, then he will do lethal damage to anyone standing in his hitbox. If he turns into a centaur, then he will do a heavy knockback.
			You have about 4 seconds to react to this, so be ready to move outside of his hitbox (snake) or pop a knockback invuln (centaur).
			For centaur, you can also move to the center of his hitbox and eat the knockback if you mistimed your knockback invuln.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Conceptual Tetraflare / Conceptual Octaflare</h4>
	<p>Hephaistos will do a random <b>Conceptual Tetraflare</b> or <b>Conceptual Octaflare</b>. This will go off after the upcoming <b>Volcanic Torches</b>.</p>

	<h4>Volcanic Torches</h4>
	<p>Everyone should go to their intercard quadrant. There are 3 possible safe spots in your corner of 4 squares (the far corner is never safe).
		The safe spot will be determined by which way the flames turn as soon as they hit the first wall. Depending on your pattern, you can pre-position for the next mechanic, <b>Sunforge</b>.</p>

	<h4>Sunforge</h4>
		<p>This follows up 2 seconds after the previous <b>Volcanic Torches</b>, so you'll need to be fast.
			Depending on your <b>Volcanic Torches</b> pattern, you may need to run from your safe white square spot to your safe black square spot.
			The <b>Conceptual Tetraflare</b> / <b>Conceptual Octaflare</b> also resolves at the same time, so be ready to stack or spread while respecting the <b>Sunforge</b> column AOEs.
			If it's a <b>Conceptual Tetraflare</b>, ranged players should stack on the tanks / melees.
			The image shown is phoenix + <b>Conceptual Octaflare</b>.</p>

	<p>Here is a video example of the mechanic from ranged2's POV with <b>Conceptual Tetraflare</b> and the serpent for <b>Sunforge</b>.</p>

	<h2 id="centaur1">Reforged Reflection (Centaur 1)</h2>
	<p>The order of whether snake goes first or centaur goes first is random. This guide will assume that centaur goes first.
		Thus, the timeline for major mechanics is <b>Centaur1</b> → <b>Manifold Flames</b> → <b>Snake1</b> → <b>Fourfold Flames</b> → <b>Centaur2</b> → <b>Snake2</b> → Enrage.</p>

	<h4>Rearing Rampage</h4>
	<p>This is 4 sets of 2 AOEs each. Each AOE inflicts a vuln. Spread out to your clock spots to ensure you don't get clip other people.
		Remember which AOE you got (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th), as that will be the same order you bait AOEs in a moment.</p>

	<h4>Stomp Dead</h4>
	<p>Hephaistos will do four sets of jumps, each one being a 2-person stack with a big AOE. The players who got the 1st AOE should position NE. The players who got hit 2nd should be center.
		The 3rd and 4th pair should be on the safe spot East, but ready to move as soon as their other pairs get hit. After the 1st AOE pair gets stomped, the 3rd pair should swap with them.
		Similarly, after the 2nd AOE pair gets stomped, the 4th AOE pair should swap with them. Refer to the image below (there won't be dots over your head, that's just for guide stuffs).</p>

	<h4>Illusory Creation + Creation on Command</h4>
	<p>Hephaistos will spawn 4 clones of himself, 1 on each cardinal. 2 clones (always adjacent to each other) will create a phoenix and a serpent.
		The party should position themselves in the row or column directly in front of the phoenix (but not the center square), as these will be the safe spots.
		In the image below, notice how we line up based on our intercard partners (with melees close and ranged far).</p>

	<h2 id="manifold">Manifold Flames</h2>
	<p>Either all 4 supports or all 4 DPS will be hit by an AOE that inflicts vuln. The people that weren't hit should go inside Hephaistos's hitbox on the intercards to bait a proximity line AOE
		(the intercard you take is the same as your regular intercard, so M1 or H1 would take SW). If you were hit by the vuln AOE, be on any cardinal to avoid the baiters' line AOEs.</p>
