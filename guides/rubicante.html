	<h1>Mount Ordeals (Extreme)</h1>

	<p>Mount Ordeals (Extreme) is a high-end duty added in patch 6.3: Gods Revel, Lands Tremble.
		The fight can be unlocked by speaking to The Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan (12.7, 14.3) after completing Mount Ordeals.
	</p>

	<p>The minimum ilvl required to enter this fight is 610.</p>

	<h2>Rubicante's Abilities</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b><u>Inferno</u></b>: A heavy raidwide attack. When Rubicante casts off his mantle and becomes purple, <b>Inferno</b> becomes a spread AOE.</li>
		<li><b><u>Shattering Heat</u></b>: A heavy tankbuster.</li>
		<li><b><u>Dualfire</u></b>: A double tankbuster that does 90 degree cleaves on each tank.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Ordeal of Purgation</h2>
	<p>Rubicante always casts <b>Ordeal of Purgation</b> twice at a time. Like in the Normal difficulty, he sends out either 1 or 2 fireballs from the center that follow a path and ignite the sigil at the
        end of the path. <b>Ordeal of Purgation</b> will either send out 2 fireballs and only spin the middle circle, or it will
        send out 1 fireball and spin the innermost and outermost circles.</p>
    <p>In Extreme, an orange rectangle has been added alongside the Normal difficulty's blue triangle. When the orange rectangle is detonated, it will blow up the half of the field that it is on.
        When a blue triangle is detonated, it does a conal cleave originating from the sigil.</p>

    <p>Here is an example pattern of <b>Ordeal of Purgation</b>, which sends out 1 fireball and has 2 spinning circles.</p>

	<h4>Arch Inferno</h4>
	<p>Circle AOEs will rotate the field, with safe spots directly across from each other. Party 1 should take the North safe spot, and Party 2 should take the South safe spot.</p>

	<h4>Spike of Flame / Twinfold Flame / Fourfold Flame</h4>
	<p>Rubicante will cast 1 of these 3 attacks. <b>Spike of Flame</b> is 8 spread AOEs targeting each player. <b>Twinfold Flame</b> is a set of 4 enumeration stacks that require 2 people inside of each stack.
        <b>Fourfold Flame</b> is a light party stack.</p>

	<h4>Conflagration</h4>
	<p>A line AOE that cleaves in front and behind of Rubicante.</p>

	<h4>Spike of Flame / Twinfold Flame / Fourfold Flame</h4>
	<p>Rubicante will cast another 1 of these 3 attacks, but not the same attack used previously.</p>

	<h4>Radial Flagration</h4>
	<p>After the spinning circle AOEs from <b>Arch Inferno</b> finish, cleaves that target each player will go out. Spread to clock spots in order to not overlap conal cleaves.</p>

	<h2 id="adds">Add Phase</h2>
	<p>Rubicante will begin charging Rubicante's Power. 6 adds will spawn.</p>
    <p>The center add will apply a DoT every few seconds, stacking the effect the longer the add is alive.</p>
    <p>The north add will scatter random AOEs on the field.</p>
    <p>The 2 northwest and northeast adds will tether to random players and do heavy-hitting attacks. Tanks should grab tethers and take the attack.</p>
    <p>The 2 southwest and southeast adds will tether to random players do conal cleaves. Tethered players should point the cleave out towards the edge of the field to avoid hitting other players.</p>

    <h4>Blazing Rapture</h4>
    <p>Rubicante will unleash a powerful attack that increases in strength the higher the Rubicante's Power gauge is. A gauge of 100 will result in a wipe.</p>

    <h4>Rubicante casts off his mantle, revealing his true power!</h4>
    <p>Rubicante will gain a purple fire effect, which will allow him to do difficult mechanics and change other ones.</p>

    <h2 id="flamespirebrand">Flamespire Brand</h2>
	<p>Rubicante will apply debuffs to the party. Everyone will receive a long spread debuff. Other debuffs are role-based. The role with only the long spread debuff or the long spread debuff + a stack marker
        should stack up then spread out. The role with the long spread debuff + a triangle debuff should spread and stay spread away from others. In the below image, the DPS have to stack then spread,
        and the supports have to spread and stay spread out.
    </p>

    <h4>Flamerake</h4>
    <p>Rubicante will spin a cross, which will end up pointing to all cardinals or to all intercardinals. He will then do a large X-shaped cleave that spreads out. The stacking role from
        <b>Flamespire Brand</b> should dodge into the center to stack, while the spreading role should stay out of the center to give the stacking role space.</p>

    <p>Here is a video example of the stacking role, which goes to the center and then spreads to clock spots.</p>

    <p>Here is a video example of the spreading role, which stays out and dodges between line AOEs, then spreads to clock spots.</p>

    <h4>Inferno (Spread)</h4>
    <p>While in his purple fire mode, <b>Inferno</b> will do a 8 large spread AOEs targeting every player. Ensure you are spread out to not die.</p>

    <h4>Scalding Ring / Scalding Signal</h4>
    <p>Rubicante will do either <b>Scalding Ring</b> or <b>Scalding Signal</b>, which are a donut AOE or a circle AOE respectively. Either be inside his hitbox or outside of it to avoid the AOE.
        Immediately after the donut / circle, he will do line AOEs that target every player, so be sure to be in clock spots. As in Normal, the line AOE will shoot back through the arena in the same
        angle it shot out at, like the line AOEs in <i>Crown of the Immaculate</i>. Angling the line AOEs out to clock spots ensures consistency and a predictable way to dodge the returning line AOEs later.</p>

    <h4>Sweeping Immolation</h4>
    <p>Rubicante will face a direction and do a half-room cleave in the direction he is facing. Be in the half of the room behind him to avoid the half-room cleave. He will also raise his cape to 
        telegraph either a light party stack centered on healers, or a spread attack that hits everyone. One large star on each side denotes light party stacks. Four small stars on each side denote spread AOEs.</p>
	<img src="./../images/rubicante/Sweeping_Immolation_Stack_or_Spread_Telegraph.png">

    <h4>Dualfire</h4>
    <p>Rubicante does two simultaneous double tankbusters with 90 degree cleaves. Make sure the tanks are properly spread away from each other.
        After <b>Dualfire</b>, Rubicante extinguishes his purple fire mode. This means that <b>Inferno</b> attacks will go back to being raidwides instead of spreads.</p>
    
    <h2 id="flamespireclaw">Flamespire Claw</h2>
    <p>After several repeated mechanics, Rubicante will do <b>Flamespire Claw</b>, his last unique mechanic. Limit Cut dots will appear over everyone's heads, which denote the order in which he does
        large cleaves on players. There are multiple ways to resolve this, but I prefer having odd-numbered players stack in the West safe spot and even-numbered players stack in the East safe spot.
        Odds will resolve their cleave North, and Evens will resolve their cleave South. At the same time, tethers will attach to random players. These tethers will gradually give the tethered player a stack
        of Flamespire. Accumulating 5 stacks of Flamespire will result in a wipe. Players need to trade off the tether to avoid any one player accumulating too many Flamespire debuffs while resolving
        Limit Cut cleaves.</p>
	<img src="./../images/rubicante/Flamespire_Claw_Limit_Cut.png">

    <p>After this, Rubicante will loop mechanics and do another <b>Scalding Ring</b> / <b>Scalding Signal</b>, a <b>Sweeping Immolation</b>, and two more <b>Ordeal of Purgations</b>, then enrage.
        If your DPS is good and you didn't have too many deaths, you can defeat Rubicante around <b>Flamespire Claw</b>. Best of luck!</p>
