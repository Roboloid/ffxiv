	<h2><u>Boss 1: Silkie</u></h2>

	<h2>Silkie's Abilities</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b><u>Total Wash</u></b>: A heavy raidwide attack that inflicts a DoT.</li>
		<li><b><u>Carpet Beater</u></b>: A tankbuster where the boss jumps to the tank and deals damage.</li>
		<li><b><u>Dust Bluster</u></b>: A raidwide attack that deals a knockback.</li>
		<li><b><u>Bracing Suds</u></b>: Silkie infuses her tail with a green puff. When detonated, it will do a donut AOE.</li>
		<li><b><u>Chilling Suds</u></b>: Silkie infuses her tail with a blue puff. When detonated, it will do cardinal line AOEs relative to where she is facing.</li>
		<li><b><u>Fizzling Suds</u></b>: Silkie infuses her tail with a yellow puff. When detonated, it will do intercardinal conal cleaves relative to where she is facing.</li>
		<li><b><u>Slippery Soap</u></b>: A line stack that detonates Silkie's sud after the stack resolves. The player with the stack should be the furthest back, with other players in between them and Silkie. The effect changes depending on her sud.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>If Silkie has <img src="./../images/criterion1/Bracing_Suds.png" class="imgIcon"> Bracing Suds, Silkie will heavily knockback players and follow up with a donut AOE.</li>
			<li>If Silkie has <img src="./../images/criterion1/Chilling_Suds.png" class="imgIcon"> Chilling Suds, players must be moving when the stack resolves in order to not be frozen. She then
					follows up with cardinal line AOEs.</li>
			<li>If Silkie has <img src="./../images/criterion1/Fizzling_Suds.png" class="imgIcon"> Fizzling Suds, Silkie will inflict a debuff to all players hit by the stack. When the debuff expires, a small
				spread AOE will go off that will deal heavy damage and paralyze anyone clipped by other people's spreads. She will do intercardinal conal cleaves at the same time the debuff expires.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>

	<h2>Fresh Puff 1</h2>
	<p>Silkie will spawn three puffs in a triangle pattern. She then will cast <b>Bracing Suds</b> followed by <b>Squeaky Clean</b>. <b>Squeaky Clean</b> will do two 90 degree cleaves followed by a 225 degree cleave.
		The side that Silkie starts on will be the safe side for the 225 degree cleave.</p>
	<p>She follows up with <b>Chilling Suds</b> into <b>Slippery Soap</b>. There should be two green puffs on the field. Players should aim the line stack through one of the green puffs depending on the color and
		position of the non-green puff. The goal is to leave only one green puff on the field, as players would not be able to resolve two green puffs (two donut AOEs) without being damaged. You should be aiming
		towards the green puff that would be hit by the non-green puff. Remember to keep moving to avoid being frozen, then dodge intercardinal relative to Silkie to avoid the cardinal line AOEs.</p>
	<p>In the below example, a yellow puff is SW and green puffs are on North and SE. The yellow puff would hit the North puff. Changing the North
		puff to blue leaves the SE puff as the only green puff, and players would be able to stand SE and avoid all puff attacks.</p>

	<h2>Fresh Puff 2</h2>
	<p>Silkie will cast either <b>Bracing Suds</b> or <b>Chilling Suds</b>, then cast <b>Fresh Puff</b> and spawn four puffs. The puffs will either be on all cardinals or all intercardinals, and there will be
		two blue puffs and two yellow puffs. Same-color puffs are always opposite to each other. Each puff will tether to each player and jump towards them after a few seconds. Depending on whether Silkie uses
		<b>Bracing Suds</b> or <b>Chilling Suds</b>, players will want to drag puffs to leave the center safe or leave a corner safe.</p>
	<p>There are several ways to resolve this mechanic. The patterns and pictures below are one of many ways to make a safe spot.</p>
	<img style="width: 700px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff2_GreenIntercard.png">
	<img style="width: 700px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff2_GreenCard.png">

	<img style="width: 700px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff2_BlueCard.png">

	<p>After this, Silkie will use one of <b>Bracing Suds</b> / <b>Chilling Suds</b> / <b>Fizzling Suds</b> combined with <b>Slippery Soap</b>. Be ready to ride the knockback, keep moving, or dodge after the stack
		depending on which sud she uses.</p>

	<h2>Fresh Puff 3</h2>
	<p>Silkie will spawn eight puffs in a 4x2 pattern. She will follow up with <b>Eastern Ewers</b>, which will clean off six puffs. Take note of the colors of the remaining two and dodge accordingly.</p>
	<p>Next, Silkie will use <b>Chilling Suds</b> and do a <b>Carpet Beater</b>. The tank should stand East or West in order to position Silkie inline with the remaining six puffs. Silkie will do a
		<b>Slippery Soap</b> line stack targeting the healer. They should position at the opposite end of the field so that Silkie dashes through all the puffs.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff3_1.png">

	<p>The tank should drag Silkie in the empty column in order to avoid the upcoming cardinal line AOEs coming from the remaining puffs. Silkie will use <b>Bracing Suds</b> and lock in her position, so be sure
		to move her into the safe spot before that happens. She will use <b>Soaping Spree</b> and detonate all puffs. Stand inside of her hitbox to avoid all of the line AOEs and the donut going off.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff3_2.png">
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff3_3.png">

	<h2>Fresh Puff 4</h2>
	<p>This is the final set of new mechanics. Silkie will spawn four blue puffs in the South part of the field that tether to each player. Silkie will use <b>Bracing Suds</b> followed by <b>Squeaky Clean</b>.
		Players need to drag the puffs away from the incoming 225 degree cleave, as this will create multiple green puffs that overlap donut AOEs with no safe spot. The uptime strat is to stand on Silkie's
		hitbox and be ready to move left or right, whichever side Silkie lands on first. Players will be able to pull the puffs away from the unsafe side will maintaining uptime.</p>

	</video>

	<p>After this, Silkie will do two sets of <b>Bracing Suds</b> / <b>Chilling Suds</b> / <b>Fizzling Suds</b> with <b>Slippery Soap</b>, followed by a <b>Total Wash</b> serving as enrage.</p>
