	</p>

	<p>The minimum ilvl required to enter this fight is 610.</p>

	<h2><u>Boss 1: Silkie</u></h2>

	<h2>Silkie's Abilities</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b><u>Total Wash</u></b>: A raidwide attack that inflicts a DoT.</li>
		<li><b><u>Carpet Beater</u></b>: A tankbuster where the boss jumps to the tank and deals damage.</li>
		<li><b><u>Dust Bluster</u></b>: A raidwide attack that deals a knockback.</li>
		<li><b><u>Bracing Suds</u></b>: Silkie infuses her tail with a green puff. When detonated, it will do a donut AOE.</li>
		<li><b><u>Chilling Suds</u></b>: Silkie infuses her tail with a blue puff. When detonated, it will do cardinal line AOEs relative to where she is facing.</li>
		<li><b><u>Fizzling Suds</u></b>: Silkie infuses her tail with a yellow puff. When detonated, it will do intercardinal conal cleaves relative to where she is facing.</li>
		<li><b><u>Slippery Soap</u></b>: A line stack that detonates Silkie's sud after the stack resolves. The player with the stack should be the furthest back, with other players in between them and Silkie. The effect changes depending on her sud.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>If Silkie has <img src="./../images/criterion1/Bracing_Suds.png" class="imgIcon"> Bracing Suds, Silkie will heavily knockback players and follow up with a donut AOE.</li>
			<li>If Silkie has <img src="./../images/criterion1/Chilling_Suds.png" class="imgIcon"> Chilling Suds, players must be moving when the stack resolves in order to not be frozen. She then
					follows up with cardinal line AOEs.</li>
			<li>If Silkie has <img src="./../images/criterion1/Fizzling_Suds.png" class="imgIcon"> Fizzling Suds, Silkie will inflict a 3s <img src="./../images/criterion1/Forked_Lightning.png" class="imgIcon"> debuff to all players hit by the stack. When the debuff expires, a small
				spread AOE will go off that will deal heavy damage and paralyze anyone clipped by other people's spreads. She will do intercardinal conal cleaves at the same time the debuff expires.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>

	<h2>Fresh Puff 1</h2>
	<p>Silkie will spawn three puffs in a triangle pattern. She then will cast <b>Bracing Suds</b> followed by <b>Squeaky Clean</b>. <b>Squeaky Clean</b> will do two 90 degree cleaves followed by a 225 degree cleave.
		The side that Silkie starts on will be the safe side for the 225 degree cleave.</p>
	<p>She follows up with <b>Chilling Suds</b> into <b>Slippery Soap</b>. There should be two green puffs on the field. Players should aim the line stack through one of the green puffs depending on the color and
		position of the non-green puff. The goal is to leave only one green puff on the field, as players would not be able to resolve two green puffs (two donut AOEs) without being damaged. You should be aiming
		towards the green puff that would be hit by the non-green puff. Remember to keep moving to avoid being frozen, then dodge intercardinal relative to Silkie to avoid the cardinal line AOEs.</p>
	<p>In the below example, a yellow puff is SW and green puffs are on North and SE. The yellow puff would hit the North puff. Changing the North
		puff to blue leaves the SE puff as the only green puff, and players would be able to stand SE and avoid all puff attacks.</p>
	<img style="width: 333px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff1_1.png">
	<img style="width: 333px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff1_2.png">
	<img style="width: 333px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff1_3.png">
	<img style="width: 333px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff1_4.png">

	<h2>Fresh Puff 2</h2>
	<p>Silkie will cast either <b>Bracing Suds</b> or <b>Chilling Suds</b>, then cast <b>Fresh Puff</b> and spawn four puffs. The puffs will either be on all cardinals or all intercardinals, and there will be
		two blue puffs and two yellow puffs. Same-color puffs are always opposite to each other. Each puff will tether to each player and jump towards them after a few seconds. Depending on whether Silkie uses
		<b>Bracing Suds</b> or <b>Chilling Suds</b>, players will want to drag puffs to leave the center safe or leave a corner safe.</p>
	<p>There are several ways to resolve this mechanic. The patterns and pictures below are one of many ways to make a safe spot.</p>
	<img style="width: 700px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff2_GreenIntercard.png">
	<img style="width: 700px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff2_GreenCard.png">
	<img style="width: 700px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff2_BlueIntercard.png">
	<img style="width: 700px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff2_BlueCard.png">

	<p>After this, Silkie will use one of <b>Bracing Suds</b> / <b>Chilling Suds</b> / <b>Fizzling Suds</b> combined with <b>Slippery Soap</b>. Be ready to ride the knockback, keep moving, or dodge after the stack
		depending on which sud she uses.</p>

	<h2>Fresh Puff 3</h2>
	<p>Silkie will spawn eight puffs in a 4x2 pattern. She will follow up with <b>Eastern Ewers</b>, which will clean off six puffs. Take note of the colors of the remaining two and dodge accordingly.</p>
	<p>Next, Silkie will use <b>Chilling Suds</b> and do a <b>Carpet Beater</b>. The tank should stand East or West in order to position Silkie inline with the remaining six puffs. Silkie will do a
		<b>Slippery Soap</b> line stack targeting the healer. They should position at the opposite end of the field so that Silkie dashes through all the puffs.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff3_1.png">

	<p>The tank should drag Silkie in the empty column in order to avoid the upcoming cardinal line AOEs coming from the remaining puffs. Silkie will use <b>Bracing Suds</b> and lock in her position, so be sure
		to move her into the safe spot before that happens. She will use <b>Soaping Spree</b> and detonate all puffs. Stand inside of her hitbox to avoid all of the line AOEs and the donut going off.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff3_2.png">
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff3_3.png">

	<h2>Fresh Puff 4</h2>
	<p>This is the final set of new mechanics. Silkie will spawn four blue puffs in the South part of the field that tether to each player. Silkie will use <b>Bracing Suds</b> followed by <b>Squeaky Clean</b>.
		Players need to drag the puffs away from the incoming 225 degree cleave, as this will create multiple green puffs that overlap donut AOEs with no safe spot. The uptime strat is to stand on Silkie's
		hitbox and be ready to move left or right, whichever side Silkie lands on first. Players will be able to pull the puffs away from the unsafe side will maintaining uptime.</p>

		<source src="./../images/criterion1/Silkie_Puff4_Left.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
	</video>

	<p>After this, Silkie will do two sets of <b>Bracing Suds</b> / <b>Chilling Suds</b> / <b>Fizzling Suds</b> with <b>Slippery Soap</b>, followed by a <b>Total Wash</b> serving as enrage.</p>

	<h2><u>Boss 2: Gladiator of Sil'dih</u></h2>

	<h2>Gladiator of Sil'dih's Abilities</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b><u>Flash of Steel</u></b>: A raidwide attack.</li>
		<li><b><u>Sculptor's Passion</u></b>: A line stack where the first person in line takes more damage. The tank should be first in line.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Specter of Might</h2>
	<p>The Gladiator will spawn two clones at corners of the field and notches will appear on the field. They will pulse one to three times, with the number of pulses being how many notches they will
		dash. After a delay, they will dash forward and do a 180 degree cleave in front of them, then behind them. Players should stack inside where the notches will intersect (relative to the center of the
		field) to dodge the first cleave, then move out to dodge the second cleave. The Gladiator will do this move twice.</p>

	<video width="720" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
		<source src="./../images/criterion1/Gladiator_SpecterMight.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
	</video>

	<p>Afterwards, the Gladiator will do a line stack where the first person in line takes extra damage, with a tankbuster afterwards.</p>

	<h2>Curse of the Fallen</h2>
	<p>The Gladiator will assign all four players the <img src="./../images/criterion1/Echo_of_the_Fallen.png" class="imgIcon"> Echo of the Fallen debuff, which will do a spread AOE when the timer expires. One
		player will also have <img src="./../images/criterion1/Lingering_Echoes.png" class="imgIcon"> Lingering Echoes, which will do a sustained AOE when it expires. One other player will also have
		<img src="./../images/criterion1/Thunderous_Echo.png" class="imgIcon"> Thunderous Echo, which is a stack AOE. A strategy that works is to have your healer put shields on the player with the stack
		and just ignore that debuff.</p>
	<p>Before the timers go off, the Gladiator will cast <b>Ring of Might</b>, which functions similarly to the previous <b>Specter of Might</b>. The Gladiator will pulse one to three times, which corresponds
		to how far their attack will go. It will do an AOE into a donut. Players should spread out and be ready to move in while staying apart from one another.</p>

	<video width="720" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
		<source src="./../images/criterion1/Gladiator_RingMight.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
	</video>

	<h2>Hateful Visage + Accursed Visage</h2>
	<h4>Hateful Visage</h4>
	<p>The Gladiator will spawn several heads that fire gold or silver lasers. If you divide the field into squares based on how big the incoming line AOEs are, each quadrant of the field is 4x4 large. The head
		lasers are 2 squares wide. There will also be orange line AOEs that fire in a cross pattern that are one square wide. There will also be a spread AOE at the end. Players should spread one per quadrant and
		dodge the orange line AOEs in the safe 2x2 square that won't be hit by gold and silver lasers.</p>
	<img style="width: 333px" src="./../images/criterion1/Gladiator_HatefulVisage_1.png">
	<img style="width: 333px" src="./../images/criterion1/Gladiator_HatefulVisage_2.png">
	<img style="width: 333px" src="./../images/criterion1/Gladiator_HatefulVisage_3.png">
	<img style="width: 333px" src="./../images/criterion1/Gladiator_HatefulVisage_4.png">

	<h4>Accursed Visage</h4>
	<p>The Gladiator will do the same move again, but this time with debuffs. One player will have 2 stacks of <img src="./../images/criterion1/Gilded_Fate.png" class="imgIcon">, another player will have 2 stacks
		of <img src="./../images/criterion1/Silvered_Fate.png" class="imgIcon">, and two players will have 1 stack each of <img src="./../images/criterion1/Gilded_Fate.png" class="imgIcon"> and
		<img src="./../images/criterion1/Silvered_Fate.png" class="imgIcon">. The debuff functions like a temperature gauge from previous dungeons. Players need to get hit by lasers of the opposite color in order
		to cleanse their debuff. If they do not cleanse their debuff when it expires, they will die. So, the player with 2 stacks of <img src="./../images/criterion1/Gilded_Fate.png" class="imgIcon"> should be
		hit by two silver lasers, the player with 2 stacks of <img src="./../images/criterion1/Silvered_Fate.png" class="imgIcon"> should be hit by two gold lasers, and the players with one each of
		<img src="./../images/criterion1/Gilded_Fate.png" class="imgIcon"> and <img src="./../images/criterion1/Silvered_Fate.png" class="imgIcon"> should be hit by one laser of each color. Each player should go to
		one quadrant and be in line with the lasers. Make sure to dodge orange line AOEs and spread out while doing so.</p>

		<source src="./../images/criterion1/Gladiator_AccursedVisage.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
	</video>

	<h2>Curse of the Monument</h2>
	<p>This is the last unique mechanic. Two players will receive a <img src="./../images/common/First_in_Line.png" class="imgIcon"> debuff and two players will receive a
		<img src="./../images/common/Second_in_Line.png" class="imgIcon"> debuff, denoting the order they will explode with spread AOEs later. Don't worry about this one for now.</p>
	<p>Supports will be tethered together and DPS will be tethered together. Players should split to stretch their tether and break it. There will be circle AOEs that spread out around the field, leaving
		one safe spot in a North corner and one safe spot in a South corner. Have the tank and melee DPS go to the North corner and the healer and ranged DPS go to the South corner. Be ready to dodge the spreading
		circle AOEs.</p>
	<p>After this, two towers will appear. The players with the <img src="./../images/common/Second_in_Line.png" class="imgIcon"> should take the towers, and the
		<img src="./../images/common/First_in_Line.png" class="imgIcon"> players should spread out to explode without clipping other people. Then, two more towers will spawn. The players should swap so that the
		<img src="./../images/common/First_in_Line.png" class="imgIcon"> players who detonated should take the towers, and the <img src="./../images/common/Second_in_Line.png" class="imgIcon"> players
		should spread out to detonate.</p>

	<video width="720" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
		<source src="./../images/criterion1/Gladiator_CurseoftheMonument.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
	</video>

	<p>The Gladiator will follow up with another two <b>Specter of Might</b> attacks, a stack, raidwides, then enrage.</p>

	<h2><u>Boss 3: Shadowcaster Zeless Gah</u></h2>

	<h2>Shadowcaster Zeless Gah's Abilities</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b><u>Show of Strength</u></b>: A raidwide attack.</li>
		<li><b><u>Firesteel Fracture</u></b>: A tankbuster that cleaves in a conal shape.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Cryptic Portal 1</h2>
	<p>The boss will spawn two sets of fire arrows that will teleport to the empty circle in front of it and explode with an AOE attack when detonated. The tank and melee DPS should go North and the healer and
		ranged DPS should go South. The fire arrows will start spinning, which will rotate where they teleport by 90 degrees. The safe spot will vary depending on where the fire arrows are and which direction they
		are spinning. In addition to this, the boss will cast <b>Firesteel Strike</b> and jump on two random players. Each player in a pair has to be spread out inside of their safe corner to not get clipped by the jump,
		which will send them into the wall if hit.</p>
	<p>Here are some helpful visuals created by <a href="https://twitter.com/ramcolor_saori/status/1582783346878255119" target="_blank"><b>@ramcolor_saori</b></a> on Twitter that showcase all the patterns
		and where you should stand. These patterns work regardless of if you're in the North group or the South group since it is relative to facing the center. If the colors are different, stand between them. If
		they are both orange, stand to the left of them. If they are both blue, stand to the right of them.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Portal1_1.jpg">
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Portal1_2.jpg">
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Portal1_3.jpg">

	<h2>Cryptic Flames 1</h2>
	<p>The boss will spawn two sets of four lines (blue and orange), each with numbers of dots on them. Squares will spawn along one side of the field. He will also give everyone debuffs numbered one through four
		<img src="./../images/criterion1/First_Brand.png" class="imgIcon"> <img src="./../images/criterion1/Second_Brand.png" class="imgIcon"> <img src="./../images/criterion1/Third_Brand.png" class="imgIcon">
		<img src="./../images/criterion1/Fourth_Brand.png" class="imgIcon">. Players with matching debuffs can touch their corresponding line in order to break it. Touching the wrong line or touching the correct one in the wrong order will cause the player to blow up. The team
		needs to break tethers in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4. You'll also need to figure out if you want to break the blue lines first or the orange lines first. Start with lines that are perpendicular to the wall
		with squares on it. The squares will do large line AOEs after some time, and you want to break the lines perpendicular to them so that the entire team can move out of the way of the AOEs.</p>
	<p>In the below example, the blue lines should be broken first to avoid upcoming square attacks.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Flames1_1.png">

	<p>You also have to think about which quadrants the party should go in (they will always be diagonal from each other). See the below image. To break the blue lines, the
		<img src="./../images/criterion1/Second_Brand.png" class="imgIcon"> player could go NW or SW. However, if they went SW, they would be unable to reach the orange
		<img src="./../images/criterion1/Second_Brand.png" class="imgIcon"> line later on, as the line is North and the player would be stuck South. The correct quadrants always have the same dots on both sides
		of the quadrant. In this example, the NW corner has both <img src="./../images/criterion1/Second_Brand.png" class="imgIcon"> and <img src="./../images/criterion1/Third_Brand.png" class="imgIcon">,
		and the SE corner has both <img src="./../images/criterion1/First_Brand.png" class="imgIcon"> and <img src="./../images/criterion1/Fourth_Brand.png" class="imgIcon">. Thus, the party should split into pairs
		going NW and SE depending on what debuff the player has.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Flames1_2.png">

	<p>While you're breaking lines in order, the boss will use <b>Cast Shadow</b>, which does conal AOEs from the center of the field that gradually go off. Dodge the conals while breaking lines. When you finish with
		one set of lines, work on the other set. Note that touching a line inflicts <img src="./../images/common/Magic_Vulnerability_Up.png" class="imgIcon"> Magic Vulnerability Up, so wait for it to fall off
		before touching more lines.</p>

	<h2>Banishment</h2>
	<p>This mechanic has a lot going on, including spinning lights, rotating circles, teleports, and much more. Using the JP strat, you can simplify this mechanic a lot. If you're using the right markers, there
		will be red markers (A and 1) North and blue markers (C and 3) South. Two players will have a red spinning circle and two players will have a blue spinning circle. Simply go North or South to match the color
		of your spin. Everyone will also have a portal attached to them, which will teleport them a distance to their circle later on. Your destination will be rotated 90 degrees either clockwise or counterclockwise
		based on the color of your spin. In addition to this, players will get a debuff that forces them to take a teleport circle on the field in order to not die (unrelated to the one attached to you). If your
		teleport will end up pointing out, go out. If your teleport will end up pointing in, go in.</p>
	<p>There will be two teleport circles at each end of the field. Ride the teleport circle that will rotate into the field, and go to the nearest colored marker afterwards (A or 1,
		or C or 3) to bait cleaves. You'll be forced to teleport. Go to the nearest colored marker again to bait the second set of conal cleaves.</p>

	<video width="720" height="480" autoplay loop muted>
		<source src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Banishment.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
	</video>

	<h2>Cryptic Portal 2</h2>
	<p>The boss will spawn three squares that shoot line AOEs in the directions it is facing. They will teleport to a destination, but said destination will rotate 90 degrees. There will be four safe squares.
		Players should go in pairs and spread similar to the previous <b>Cryptic Portal</b> to take jump AOEs.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Portal2_1.png">
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Portal2_2.png">

	<h2>Cryptic Flames 2</h2>
	<p>If your DPS is good, you should be able to kill early in this mechanic. If you're confident in that, spread one person to each corner and DPS the boss down.</p>
	<img style="width: 500px" src="./../images/criterion1/Zeless_Flames2_1.png">
	
	<p>If you have to resolve the mechanic, here is how it
		goes. Players need to break lines similar to the first <b>Cryptic Flames</b>. They will also need to bait two proximity cleaves from towers, similar to <b>Banishment</b>. Touching lines and baiting cleaves
		give <img src="./../images/common/Magic_Vulnerability_Up.png" class="imgIcon"> Magic Vulnerability Up, so take time to wait for the debuff to fall off before touching more lines. While this is happening,
		the boss will use <b>Pure Fire</b> to drop baited AOEs on where people are standing. The boss will also use <b>Cast Shadow</b> to do delayed conal cleaves. The boss will follow up with a tankbuster,
		a raidwide, then enrage.</p>

	<p>If you take him down, congrats! You'll have gained 4 silver coins, which you can redeem at Old Sharlayan.</p>
